#2. Movie Ticket Pricing
#Problem: Movie tickets are priced based on age: $12 for adults (18 and over), $8 for children. Everyone gets a $2 discount on Wednesday.

age = 22
day = 'monday'

price = 12 if age >= 18 else 8
if day == 'wednesday':
        price = price - 2


print("Your age is: ", age)
print("and your ticket price is: $", price)
